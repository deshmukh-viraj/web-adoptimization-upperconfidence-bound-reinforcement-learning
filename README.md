# Web Ad Optimization using Upper Confidence Bound Reinforcement Learning
## Short Description
This repository implements web ad optimization using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning. It includes a Python script, Jupyter notebook, and dataset for experimentation.

## Features
* Implementation of the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm for web ad optimization
* Python script for running the optimization
* Jupyter notebook for interactive experimentation
* Dataset for testing the algorithm

## Installation
To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and ensure you have Python installed. Check repository files for details on required libraries and dependencies.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the Python script (`25_webadoptimization_upperconfidencebound_reinforcementlearning.py`) to execute the optimization.

## Example/Commands
To run the optimization, use the following command:
```bash
python 25_webadoptimization_upperconfidencebound_reinforcementlearning.py
```
Check the Jupyter notebook (`25_WebAdOptimization_UpperConfidenceBound_ReinforcementLearning.ipynb`) for interactive experimentation.
